## Archiving data journalism!

The fancier and more-cutting-edge the projects are, the more fragile and less likely to survive they are. - Meridith Broussard

Archiving only happens if you have someone who advocates for archiving and preservation. And this is probably a full-time job unless your organization has an ethos of making things archived and keeping them archived and paying for the uptime on the archives.

Key commonalities in archiving:
- news orgs haven't traditionally been involved in archiving
- common issues are impermanent storage media:
	- newsprint dissolves
	- tapes shred
	- servers aren't up anymore, and what you crafted may not exist any more.

The Philip Meyer Award Winner links on the wikipedia page are dying, 5/13 are 404.

Anything 5-10 years old has a pretty good shot of being dead.

Ben Welsh's commandments:
1. Thou shalt not make a mess and expect someone else to fix it for you: don't expect the Internet Archive to save your work.
2. Thou shalt publish as static files immediately (or at least eventually).
3. Thou shalt not depend on rando links. Host your own assets, packaged alongside what you're publishing.
	- but how does this work when you're using a CDN version of a js library for security updates? 
4. Thou shalt version your CSS and base templates. Don't let changes to organization CSS and templates break your site. Reference style.1.css, style.2.css
5. Thou shalt see the big archives as a platform. Don't have to hoard your static files, but they need help curating and organizing.

Idea from welsh: a wordpress plugin that pings the wayback machine every time you've published an update to a post

The Internet Archive is nto searchable by keyword; only by date. If you have to bake out an entire news app, it's a bajillion files that can link to each other, but plan fo how your site will function when it's not dynamic.

Flash is being sunset in 2020.

Four recommendations:

1. Save your work! And save it in a way that people will be able to find it in 50 years.
2. Bake it static.
3. Plan for the sunset at the time of launch. See Matt Waite's "Kill all your darlings" article on source. Think past publcation. You're the steward of the project. You're the only one who can kill it. 
	- who can keep it alive/kill it if you suffer a bus accident?
4. Work with libraries, memory institutions, and commercial archives.
	- and maybe get an archivist on staff.

The problem of archiving is not a technological problem, but a human one. We're not
