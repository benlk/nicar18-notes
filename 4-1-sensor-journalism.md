## Sensor journalism

Three sources of sensor info:

- government sensor data (released publicly or FOIA)
- private sources
- your sensors you operate

ProPublica used a measure of photosynthesis and plant health with Landsat satellite imagery.
SensorGrid does some stuff with particulate monitoring.

Tools: 

- Qgis, ArcGIS
- GDAL is QGIS in the command line
- Google Earth Engine is good for fast stuff on Google's servers, sometimes free for journalists. Good for processing lots of raster.
- Photoshop for editing rasters, Illustrator for vectors.

Don't be afraid to reach out to the data sources!

- GIS/data specialists at certain departments of NASA and NOAA
- for-profit companies who are wiling to provide free data for newsrooms (Google Earth Engine, Planet Labs)
- cartographic researchers
