## bootstrapping a * team

Like, small teams. Less than 5 people.

1. Ask what kinf od team you want.
2. Ask more what kind of team your boss wants.
	- what are the things they're big about? This may immediately inform your staff decisions.
3. What teams will your team need to work with?
	- You'll need to convince them to work with you, and mekae sure you're not the last thought in your head
	- THe foundation of every cross-department relationship is respect for other' time.
	- Process is more important than product.
4. How much of your team's success will depend on the relationshp between your team and the other teams?
5. The _last_ question you should answer is what kind of technical skills you need to hire.

When running a team:

- Envy is the greatest driver of change in newsrooms. Use it.
	- early on, be picky about what you work on.
	- Use envy to drive attnetion to you.
deciding things:
	- manage the conflict of things that you're working on, the conflict of expectations. Can you be public with what you're working on, so that your customers can see that you're dealing with other customers.
	- You decide what's higher-priority
- Plan for the "Oh Shit! " methods before it happens. Outsline the steps to deal with it:
	- Corrections
	- App crashes
	- Personal conflicts
- Voraciously address conflicts within the team, be they with an individual or between ream members. Don't let things fester. Pull people out of their process if the relationship is starting to strain, and address the root cause. Humans get emotionally worked up and that creates a blast radius, and you can't be having that. Make it a regular part of the workflow, so there's no shame involved.
- Allow for a regularly scheduled space to say what's not working, what is, and what's a better way forward.
- Keep notes on what each _job description_ does, beyond what each person does. This allows you to argue for keeping the place even if a person isn't working out in that place. Keep the place on the team so you can hire someone to fill it.
