## Security tips for newsrooms:

**There is literally nothing perfect**.

- Conference calls: meet.jit.si; maybe Wickr. Generate the call link just before the call.
- Texts: Signal, but with self-destruct on messages.
- Slack: nothing sensitive on Slack.
- Skype: no. In most countries, Skype is compromised. Governments have access to metadata and content.
- VPNs: use when you can, but [most VPNs are scams](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/post-fcc-privacy-rules-should-you-vpn/). Use a trusted VPN when you don't trust the ISP you're using, or use a VPN to get around geographic restrictions, or to hide where you are. Your VPN has the same amount of access to your Internet traffic as any ISP would.
- Phones: keep work phone and personal phones as separate devices. This separates data and prevents compromises. If you have a burner, never power it on in the same place as your human phone.
- Updates: install them asap. If you can coerce computers to shut off until stuff is updated, do so.
- Updates: If your computer is too old to be upgraded, get another computer.
- Backups: encrypt them! Zero-knowledge backups are best.
- Apple products' iCloud sync: turn it off. Unless you trust iCloud.

You have to decide where to trust the free stuff.

Do you want your messaging to be secret, or unreadable? Secret means that no one knows you're talking, unreadable means that people can know you're talking but can't read your messages.

Assume that every country is moving closer and closer to the Chinese model of network censorship and spying. If you're doing work that is likely to piss off the government (investigating profitable industries, investigating corruption) you must be secure. EFF's guides.

If your system is too hard to use, people won't use it.

If you have a shared data folder, those files are only as private as the least secure person's login.
