## Design for non-designers

Lena and Angelica

1. It's not all about looks; it's about function.
2. Contrast: if something isn't the same, make the contrast as big as possible.
	- make it easy to get the contrast.
	- call attention to the most-important thing on the page.
	- Don't center everything; make it a conscious decision
3. Have good reason if you're going to break convention.
4. Be consistent across platforms. Don't do vastly different things.
5. Repetition!
	- Train your audience to know what to expect as they're scrolling through your dataset.
	- Small multiples: when you have a lot of similar-but-different items, present them side-by-side to make it easier for brains to pick them out.
6. Hierarchy: group similar things, separate different groups. Have obvious breaks between sections. And "Section" can mean "paragraph" with "group" composed of "sentences".
	- use contrasting fonts or sizes to create hierarchy.

Always keep the user in mind. Figure out how the user really feels.

7. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Too much can be too much.
8. Design with flexibility and for the unknown. Know what things look like at high values, low values, and in between. Design for pages that you might not ever see because you can't check a million pages before publishing.
9. Design for inclusiveness. Change up the details.
	- Slack makes the "Add to Slack" button's hand brown.
	- Facebook made the man and woman icons equal sizes.
	- Put abbreviation tags around a11y, because not everyone knows that <abbr title="accessibility">a11y</abbr> means accessibility.

10. You matter. Design things that are good to you.
