> Ever wonder how other journalists manage investigations and the inevitable series of follow-ups that come with them? This panel will discuss practical and technical tips for zooming in to the smallest levels of your beat and monitor every budget line item, census tract or lawsuit you need to report the story -- and how to follow the story to the end.

[the 2017 tipsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/10pFXRsFiXS5VMQqVe2WvYKgDMze1PPoN9G-dnlIpOpU/edit#heading=h.td4rbin36dv5) and the [2018 tipsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tNEPuduYw_Qf9UywPg5TWu3QzvBf8yqOwVuyGr4xkRw/edit#heading=h.td4rbin36dv5)

FOIA ALL THE THINGS. Know your state and local laws regarding Freedom of Information, open records, and open meetings. If someone isn't replying within deadlines, file the appeal with the appropriate higher authority. Does your organization have a lawyer on call? Use them.

FOIA your FOIAs.

Be visible to your subjects. Go visit offices; hang around courthouses where the bored cops waiting to testify are. Say hi to the secretaries every couple weeks. Being physically there reminds people that you exist, and reminds them of things they were going to tell you.

Read the laws that're relevant to your beat. Open meetings laws if you cover meetings. Chemical safety laws if you cover chemicals.

Read the minutes of meetings.

When you're up against a weird public-private entity that claims exemptions from FOIA because they're not a public entity, find the places where the public agency corresponds with the private entity, and use that to get the records.

Sometimes sources are testing you to see how much you actually know.

Have a way for sources to contact you.

If someone says there's a policy, ask for a copy of the policy. If someone can't reply to you, FOIA records of emails that mention your name. Again, FOIA records of your FOIA requests.

If you're FOIAing things, use [FOIA Machine](https://www.foiamachine.org/) to help write and log your FOIAs. Or pay a little bit of money and use [MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/), which does a lot more. See also [FOIA Mapper](https://foiamapper.com/questions/). The Department of Justice [is now using](https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/doj-announces-first-iteration-new-national-foia-portal-foiagov) the [national FOIA portal](https://www.foia.gov/). Read Sandhya Kambhampati's article "[I've sent out 1,018 open records requests, and this is what I've learned](https://www.propublica.org/article/open-records-requests-illinois-foia-lessons)".
