## Putting your town under a microscope and keeping it there {#microscope}

[the 2017 tipsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/10pFXRsFiXS5VMQqVe2WvYKgDMze1PPoN9G-dnlIpOpU/edit#heading=h.td4rbin36dv5) and the [2018 tipsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tNEPuduYw_Qf9UywPg5TWu3QzvBf8yqOwVuyGr4xkRw/edit#heading=h.td4rbin36dv5)

FOIA ALL THE THINGS. Know your state and local Freedom of Information laws, and if someone isn't replying within deadlines, file the appeal with the appropriate higher authority.

FOIA your FOIAs.

Be visible. Go visit offices; hang around courthouses where the bored cops waiting to testify are. Say hi to the secretaries every couple weeks. Being physically there reminds people that you exist, and reminds them of things they were going to tell you.

Read the laws that's relevant to your beat. Open meetings laws if you cover meetings. Chemical safety laws if you cover chemicals.

Read the minutes of meetings.

When you're up against a weird public-private entity that claims exemptions from FOIA because they're not public, find the places where the public agency corresponds with the private, and use that to get the records.

Sometimes sources are testing you to see how much you actually know.

Have a way for sources to contact you.

If someone says there's a policy, ask for a copy of the policy. If someone can't reply to you, FOIA records of emails that mention your name.
