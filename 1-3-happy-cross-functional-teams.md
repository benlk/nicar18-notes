Cross-functional teams are a new thing.

No one really knows exactly where we're going. There are people who've gone before, but you still need to be ready for the difficulties that appear. At the Knight Lab we deal with non-journo students, and it's about putting people into a situation where they won't be able to do the whole thing themeselves, and so it's about working together and learning enough about each others' disciplines to know who to talk to about getting a thing done.

People who have a strong software dev background want to have thorough specifications, want to know what needs to be done to pass the requirements.

Try to understand what the other person is trying to do.

Devs need time to explore and build and learn new things that they haven't done before. Reporters often come to devs with a full story, and think that something can be done "now". Building that thing frequently requires learning a new technology. It's like photographers: you can't go to a photog the night the story will run and say, hey, can you get me some photos of this thing? You have to work with them as the story is researched and written.

This approach is a strike against a service desk mentality: integration is best and reduces conflict.

Talk things through: postmortems are necessary things for projects.

Still keep the revenue side of things separate from the journalism side.

Make sure that you know ahead of time what your measures of success for a project are.

Figure out each others' communications styles. Figure out how to say yes, and how to say no, and how to solicit and give feedback.
