## Building effective cross-functional teams

No one really knows exactly where we're going. There are people who've gone before, but you still need to be ready for the difficulties that appear. At the Knight Lab we deal with non-journo sstudents, and it's about putting people in a situation where they won't be able to do the whole thing themeselves, and so it's about working together and learning enough about each others' disciplines 

People who have a strong software dev backround want to have thorough specifications, want to know what needs to be done to pass the requirements.

Try to understand what the other person is trying to do. 

Devs need time to explore and build and learn new things that they haven't done before. Reporters often come to devs with a full story, and think that something can be done "now". 

It's a strike against a service desk mentality: integration is best and redces conflict.

Talk things through: postmortems are necessary things.

Still keep the revenue side of things separate from the journalism side.

Make sure that you know ahead of time what your measures of success are.

Figure out each others' communications styles. Figure out how to say yes, and how to say no, and how to do feedback.
