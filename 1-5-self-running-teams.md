## Conversation: building happy cross-functional teams

Speakers: Becca Aaronson, Joe Germuska, Emily Ingram

> As more newsrooms adopt a product mindset, the culture clash between traditional editorial workflows and Agile development processes often comes to a head. Learn how tech-forward newsrooms are building cross-functional teams and the lessons they've learned along the way.

In my notes, this was put down as "self-managing teams".

Self-mananging teams let you plan for the future and not have to micromanage.

The job of the manager is not to tell people what to do, but to do the shit that lets them do their jobs better. Build _teams_. Delegate everything that's fun.


it's easy to be the hub, the person with the checklist. But such people are only as good as how much sleep and caffeine they've had. They become a single point of failure.

To have a functional, happy self-managing team, you need:

1. Roles.
2. Goals.
3. Rules.

As for **rules**, you need the _right_ rules. For example, the grammar and formatting rules that comprise Associated Press Style. Having these rules decreases arguments, and probably saves you time. How do we create rules that lift weight from our backs?

You need frameworks for meetings.:

- Short morning meetings: aiming for &lt; 5 minutes per person, covers yesterday, today, and blocking things.
	- This meeting format requires being prepared.
	- State that you have a question; don't state the question itself.
	- This sort of meeting engenders empathy for teammates, which greases wheels. (Also, it's an opportunity for social stuff, but only after the meeting is done.)
- Iterations reviews: weekly reviews, possibly with stakeholders. Stakeholders care about the things that are blocking progress.
- one-on-one meetings (1:1s) are not for status updates. They're for managers to figure out how people feel.
- Retrospectives: Retrospectives are composed of several separate sections:
	- Things went well! Don't talk about the bad stuff. Everyone take 5 minutes and write stuff down.
	- Things went bad! This is the hard part. Take 7 minutes.
	- What to do differently next time. Take 10 minutes.
	- Then, and only then, days later, schedule a follow-up meeting to talk through how to do the new thing.

A thing to reread: L&iacute;via Labate on Objectives and Key Results (OKRs): https://medium.com/@livlab/sowing-the-seeds-of-okr-34768dd8f5cd

On **roles**: people need to know what their job is. Having defined roles and responsibilities lets you avoid neglect and hurt feelings. To have defined roles, have defined job descriptions. Job descriptions don't define interpersonal relations. To define interpersonal relations, use a [responsibility matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix), aka a linear responsibility chart. Who's responsible to whom, how they're responsible. The "boss" of a team isn't always the person being reported to here.

No one is too important to do QA testing, to do quality assurance testing.
