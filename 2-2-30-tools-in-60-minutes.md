A lot of the 30 tools described seemed very gimmicky, or at least poorly-thought-out, There was a recommendation for Unspash for "free" images that really, really cooled the mood in the room. It was like the presenter hadn't heard about [*Poynter*'s article about finding free images for stories](https://www.poynter.org/news/these-tools-will-help-you-find-right-images-your-stories) and the subsequent backlash. There were tag cloud tools, which [have been denounced for at least 6 years](http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/10/word-clouds-considered-harmful/).

The following seem to be work yout time:

- [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/login): free transcription tool? But at what cost....
- [SoundCite](https://soundcite.knightlab.com/) and [all the other free Knight Lab tools](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/projects/)
- [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/examples/): data viz, [free for newsrooms](https://flourish.studio/newsrooms/)
- [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) another charting software-as-a-service provider, built by journalists for journalists
