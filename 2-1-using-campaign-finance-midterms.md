## Using campaign finance data to cover midterms

- Call the donors, check to make sure that the donors aren't the candidate. If a candidate is almost entirely self-funded, do they have any actual support from the voters?
- Look out for line numbers: make sure you've covered all the bases. Not all "contributions" are contributions.
- Beware double-counting.

Use Propublica's FEC itemizer and the Election Data Bot!

- SO MUCH Information: tktk link this out
- Links out to other ProPublica information
- they run it as a public service.

To do: find the Represent links for my representatives.

There's also followthemoney.org, which can send you alerts about major funding differences.

And data is messey, hey? You have to do your own work to normalize and double-check that people are different people.
